## Installation

My react profile is deployed on Github Pages at https://tranthom618.github.io/react-profile/. However the deployed Github page requires some additional work and debugging.

You should download the contents of this repository, then save or unzip them into a single folder. Using Visual Studio Code, you can open that folder. Using the terminal, ensure the directory is in the root of the app folder. Then type "npm install", followed by "npm start" . You will be able to view my properly functioning profile on a browser at the url "http://localhost:3000/" by default, or the appropriate port you have designated. You can also install the app using the button located in the top left of the page from your local host.

## Usage

My react profile has a navigation bar that leads to different pages appropriately titled. Each page describes myself, my project portfolio, my contact information and my resume.
